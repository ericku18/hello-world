# hello-world
# It is I, Eric Ku. This will be a few conversions throughout with labs of c++ and assembly inside the rasberry pi.
# Libraries can be used are <stdlib.h>, <stdio.h>, <iostream> 
# sudo refers to the root user access. Doing sudo nano filename.cpp allows to make a c++ file, .c for just c.
# g++ -o filename filename.cpp allows an executable file be created. Filename will be the executable file name. To execute: ./filename
# printf allows the system to ask for something. scanf allows the user to put in something. Similar to cin and cout in c.
